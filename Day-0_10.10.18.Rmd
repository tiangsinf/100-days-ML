## Probability Distribution
What is the probability that I will pick a car with 4 carburetors, `mtcars$carb`?
$$P = $$
```{r}
prob <- table(mtcars$carb) / nrow(mtcars)
prob
```

Instead of making a bar chart of the frequencies, we can make a bar chart of the
probabilities. This is called a **probability mass function (PMF)**.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

prob_tbl <- as.data.frame(prob) %>%
  rename(carb = Var1, prob = Freq)

# Probability Mass Function (PMF)
ggplot(prob_tbl, aes(x = carb, y = prob)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity")
```

PMF depends on the number of bins for descrete variables to make sense. For continuous variable, **probability density function (PDF)** is used.
