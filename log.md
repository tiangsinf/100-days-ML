# 100 days of ML Challenge!

### Day-0: Oct-10, 18
**What I've learned:**
1.  PMF (for descrete variables), PDF (for continuous variables)
2.  Refresher on basic statistics (spread, population vs sample central tendency)

**What I think:**
I like how i started to understand degree on freedom, *N-1* came about! I have always wanted to know when sample sd needs to be divided by *N-1* instead of *N*.

**What I have done:**

**What I want to do for tomorrow**
1.  understand the calculus to compute area under pdf curve
2.  find a dataset and create a pdf curve.
