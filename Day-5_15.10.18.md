`family = binomial(link = logit)` is used for boolean response variable
`family = gaussian(link = identity)` is used for linear model. Equivalent to `lm()`
`family = poisson(link = log)` is used to counting respond varialbe.
There are other types of `family` as documented in https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/family

The logistic regression diagnostic values generated by the `summary()` call are typically not used directly to interpret the “goodness of fit” of a model.

### Using the logistic model (predicting on training set)

```r
glm_pred <- predict(glm_model, type = "response")

# if probability is > 0.5 than mutate the value to 1 else, 0
glm_pred <- if_else(glm_pred > 0.5, 1, 0)

head(glm_pred)
```

```
## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

```r
table(glm_pred)
```

```
## glm_pred
##    0    1 
## 8375  125
```
`type` argument is the type of prediction required. The default ("`link`") is on the scale of the linear predictors; the alternative "`response`" is on the scale of the response variable. Thus **for a default binomial model the default predictions are of log-odds (probabilities on logit scale) and `type` = "`response`" gives the predicted probabilities**. The "`terms`" option returns a matrix giving the fitted values of each term in the model formula on the linear predictor scale. 

### Convert probability into binary factor
To use `confusionMatrix`, the response variable for the training and testing set have to be a factor. The following chunck convert the default column from `num` to `factor.`

```r
train_fac <- train %>%
  mutate(default = as.factor(default))

test_fac <- test %>%
  mutate(default = as.factor(default))

glm_pred_fac <- as.factor(glm_pred)
```


```r
# Model fit on training data
caret::confusionMatrix(glm_pred_fac, train_fac$default) #95.28%
```

```
